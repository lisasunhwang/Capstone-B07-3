# Netlist Congestion Prediction
## Capstone-B07-3

### References
In this repository, we have referenced the CongestionNet paper (🔗 [Kirby et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8920342)) as well as the Graph Attention Network (GAT) paper (🔗 [Veličković et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903))

### Setup
* We need to find a way to install the digIC dataset to the users because it won't let me upload it to this repo.
* Jupyter notebooks? idk how to setup a README.md file. Will look into this.
